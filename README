__ What is Aesq? _____________________________________________________

Aesq stands for ANSI escape-sequences. It's a small library that
provides a clean interface (based on the notion of text-attributes) to
generate ANSI escape-sequences. It also supports text formatting with
lazy lists composed of text elements.

Aesq was originally written by Kaspar M. Rohrer
(kaspar.rohrer@gmail.com)

Caml-aesq is hosted on Github:
  http://github.com/krohrer/caml-aesq/

__ Installation ______________________________________________________

Unzip or untar in any directory, then run

> make

to generate the library and documentation.

To install the library using findlib, simply type

> make install

And to uninstall it

> make uninstall

For development, you may instead run

> sudo ln -s `pwd` `ocamlfind printconf path`/aesq

__ Examples __________________________________________________________

There's not much documentation right now, Run the test by typing

> make test

and take a look at test.ml.

Of course your output device must be able to interpret ANSI
escape-sequences, otherwise the text will be garbled.

Support for hyphenation is planned. I have not yet decided on a good
interface, however. Maybe extending Text.raw with RWordBreak /
RSoftHyphen would be a good idea. And then let Text.format handle
the placement of hyphens. We'll see.
